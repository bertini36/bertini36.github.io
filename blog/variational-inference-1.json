Last months I was learning about this\n\tfield, specifically about a type of inference on these models known as Variational Inference, and I reckon can be\n\tinteresting to write a set of posts summarizing my experience about it thanks to my teacher\n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapdevilaPujol\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Joan Capdevila</a>.\n</p>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Probabilistic Machine Learning</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tLast decades studies about machine learning has caused the appearance of a wide variety of algorithms to solve\n\ta large set of problems covering areas such as driving autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, speech recognition\n\tor user ranking for marketing campaigns. These algorithms are mainly based on aa construction of a model which\n\tdescribes data as closely as possible.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tA model is a compact description of a set of data that avoids us to make predictions about future samples. The main\n\tdifference between a conventional machine learning model and a probabilistic one is that the last avoids to model\n\tuncertainty, in other words, it avoids to know how probably is a prediction to be fulfilled. This aspect can\n\tbe very valuable in areas such as medicine or economy where risk about to take a bad decision can be detrimental to\n\ta person's health or lead to financial loss.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/schema_situation.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Probabilistic Machine Learning situation\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tProbabilistic machine learning situation at artificial intelligence area\n</figcaption>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis kind of models uses the probability theory to model priori information, in this way the algorithm is not\n\tbased just on sample data. These models permit the use of different datasets to learn (this is useful when\n\twe have a small quantity of data) and to define complex models with a quantity of random variables required.\n\tThey also support online leaning, you don't need to retrain the full model each time you obtain new data, you just\n\trequire to update some probabilities. They are also very useful in decision-making, when a robust explanation of a\n\tmodel is required. Finally they are generative models, thanks to the distributions that they infer, they allow\n\tto generate new data simulating values â€‹â€‹of any random variable of the model.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tUnlike discriminant models which only model the probability of the variable to be predicted, a generative model is\n\ta complete model which uses all the variables (observed and latent), allowing multiple questions to be\n\tanswered.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe construction of this type of models with latent variables is done following Box Loop philosophy. This loop\n\twas created by the statistician\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">George E. P. Box</a>. This loop is\n\titerated several times during the construction of a probabilistic model.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/box_loop.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Box loop\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tBox loop graphical scheme\n</figcaption>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>First, probabilistic model is made based on environment knowledge that we already have.</li>\n\t<li>After some patterns are discovered using the model previously defined and with an inference method.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFinally the model has to be validated. If it was not good enough we would go back to step 1 unless it would be\n\t\tused to describe or predict new data.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Bayesian inference</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tBayesian inference tries to reveal a hidden structure in data that cannot be directly observed. For\n\ttraditional machine learning methods parameters are values that are determined by optimization algorithms\n\tminimizing an error function. The bayesian point of view is a little bit different. For a bayesian all the\n\tunknown parameters are described by probability distributions and observation of evidence avoids to update\n\tthese distrubutions using Bayes rule.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Bayes rule</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe first thing you need to be clear about to understand Bayesian inference is Bayes rule. Bayes rule indicates\n\thow a priori probability about an event has to be updated after observe evidences about it. From a bayesian point\n\tof view there are no differences between parameters and observed variables, both are random variables. I'm going to\n\tuse x to reference observed variables and Î¸ to reference latent variables.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image md:w-1/6 sm:w-1/2\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/bayes_rule.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Bayes rule\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe following explains what is each term of the formula, being x and &theta; data and model\n\tparameters respectively:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Posterior p(&theta;|x)</strong>: It is the probability of data, the probability that the model with &theta;\n\t\tparameters has generated x data.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Likelihood p(x|&theta;)</strong>: It is the probability of data assuming that are modeled by a\n\t\tparametrized distribution. The way to calculate it depends on the model. Usually it is used to assess\n\t\tthe quality of a model.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Prior p(&theta;)</strong>: It is the probability of the parameters. In this factor of the formula\n\t\tis where prior knowledge is reflected, information that we have before to observe any data\n\t\tobservation.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Evidence p(x)</strong>: This is the evidence from data. It is calculated as &int; p(x,&theta;)d&theta;. Usually it\n\t\tcan't be calculated but, as it is a normalizing constant of the model, it does not affect. When two\n\t\tprobabilistic models are compared, important factors are the ones which depend on Î¸ because p(x) will be\n\t\tthe same for each model because it just depends on data.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tProduct p(x|Î¸)p(Î¸) is also known as joint probability: p(Î¸,x).\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tUse the likelihood to estimate Î¸ parameters is known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) while if you take\n\tthe prior into account then is known as Maximum A Posteriori estimation (MAP). MLE and MAP are equivalents if\n\tthere is an uniform prior. However these methods only allow estimating a mean, a median and a mode of the\n\tposterior and maybe your goal requires to model uncertainty or to generate new data. In theses cases we would need\n\tto know posterior distribution. As we will see, methods as Variational Inference (VI) or Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n\t(MCMC) allow to infer this distribution. Taking into account the Bayes normalizer constant p(x) is what allows\n\tthese methods to calculate a posterior distribution.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tA summary of this formula would be: At the beginning we have a belief (prior) about an event Î¸ (p(Î¸)), for example,\n\tthat the height of Barcelona population is described by a Normal distribution. After we observe evidences (x),\n\ta sample of the heights of Barcelona population. With this evidence our belief about Î¸ has to be updated, in\n\tother words, Normal distribution which described the height of Barcelona population has to be updated. This\n\tchange is reflected by the posterior distribution (p(Î¸|x)). In this example we can appreciate the support to\n\tonline learning that offers this kind of models.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/online_learning.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Online learning\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tAt the end it is an iterative process of updating beliefs (prior) based on evidences (x) where posterior of one\n\titeration will be the prior of next one.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tPosterior inference algorithms avoid to analyze information under certain assumptions (priors) discovering a\n\thidden structure which best fits with our data. When all relations between model random variable are\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">conjugated</a>, this is, when joint\n\tdistribution has the same form as the prior, posterior can be calculated analytically. This is the\n\tcase of models like Dirichlet-Categorical o Normal Inverse Wishart-Normal. In the opposite case, the problem of\n\tthis formula resides in the calculation of the evidence (p(x)). For many models of interest (no conjugated) to\n\tcalculate a posterior is computationally intractable because the integral over all latent variables of data\n\tthat requires to calculate the evidence. For these models, another strategy is required to obtain the posterior,\n\tfor that reason the calculation of the posterior becomes an approximation problem.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Posterior approximation</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tProbabilistic machine learning uses latent variables to describe data hidden structure, some relations\n\tbetween observed and latent variables are modeled using probability distributions and inference algorithms are used\n\tto estimate the posterior, that is the conditional distribution about latent variables given the observed\n\tvariables. Due to the fact that in most cases we are working in spaces with many dimensions, the calculation of\n\tposterior expectation, E(p(Î¸|x)), is impossible to obtain analytically and computationally, for this reason some\n\tinference methods have been created to approximate this distribution. Bayesian inference concept comes from the\n\tset of tools which have been developed to approximate this posterior and it is one of the central problems in\n\tbayesian statistics. Nowadays there are 2 algorithmic branches:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\tMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n\t\t</a>:\n\t\tSampling approximate inference.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\tVariational Inference (VI)\n\t\t</a>:\n\t\tStructural approximate inference.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tOn the one hand, MCMC is based on the construction of a Markov chain over all latent variables being the posterior\n\tits stationary distribution. After the chain is executed till it arrives to its equilibrium point.\n\tFinally, results obtained sampling the Markov chain in its stationary section, are the posterior samples. The\n\tbest known algorithms of this family are\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Metropolisâ€“Hastings</a>\n\t, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Gibbs sampling</a> and\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo\">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a>.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tOn the other hand, Variational Inference approximates the posterior creating an analytical approximation, the\n\tvariational model, which is adjusted in order to reduce the distance with the posterior. In this family the\n\tproblem is transformed from an approximation one to an optimization one.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Probabilistic Graphical Models</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIn the bayesian field, a model represents a joint probability over all random variables of the problem.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image md:w-1/5 sm:w-4/5\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/joint_dist.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Joint distribution\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tA very practical way of representing these models is using\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">probabilistic graphical models</a>. A\n\tprobabilistic graphical model is a directed graph where nodes are random variables and edges are dependency\n\trelations between those variables. For example, joint distribution probabilistic graphical model is:\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image md:w-1/4 sm:w-64\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/joint_dist2.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Joint distribution\">\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/graphical_model.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Joint distribution\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tAt this context, p(x|y) represents the conditional probability in which <i>x</i> variable depends on the\n\tvalue of y. At this kind of diagrams also exists another components called plates.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/plate.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Plate\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis notation indicates a vector of n random variables <i>x</i>.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Local and global variables</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIn a probabilistic model two types of random variables can be distinguished: globals and locals. A global variable\n\tis the one which is shared between all dataset examples while a local variable is owned by each example. For\n\texample, the following probabilistic graphical model, <i>y</i> variable is local while <i>z</i> variable is a\n\tglobal one. When a node appears obscured it means that it is an observed variable.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/global_local_variables.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Model example\">\n</figure>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Variational inference</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIn next posts we will focus on the different variational strategies for posterior approach.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Strategy</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tAs already mentioned, Variational Inference consists in defining a distribution, q(&theta;|&lambda;), whose parameters &lambda;\n\twill be optimized in order to reduce the differences with the posterior p(&theta;|x). This new distribution is known as\n\tvariational model and the posterior as probabilistic model. To summarize, VI goal is to optimize variational model\n\t&lambda; parameters in order to reduce the distance with probabilistic model p(&theta;|x). &lambda; parameters are known also as\n\tvariational parameters.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/variational_inference.jpg\"\n\t\t alt=\"Variational inference\">\n</figure>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Kullback-Leibler divergence</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tTo calculate Euclidean distance between distribution parameters to establish the similarity between both is an\n\timperfect measure since we are comparing distributions and not points. Imagine a Normal distribution with 0 mean\n\tand 5 variance, N(0, 5), and another one with 5 mean and 5 variance, N(5, 5). These two distributions are very\n\tsimilar but they are separated by an Euclidean distance of 5. If now we compare first defined Normal distribution\n\tN(0, 5) with another Normal distribution with 2 mean and 7 variance, N(2, 7), looks like they are more different\n\tbut Euclidean distance that separates them is 4. For this reason we have to use another measure: Kullback-Leibler\n\tdivergence (KL).\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tKL is a divergence, in other words, a non-simmetric distance, it isn't the same to calculate KL[p(Î¸|x)||q(Î¸|Î»)]\n\t(forwards KL) than KL[q(Î¸|Î»)||p(Î¸|x)] (reverse KL). The fact of use one or another rises to different algorithms:\n\t <a href=\"https://tminka.github.io/papers/ep/minka-ep-uai.pdf\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Expectation Propagation</a> uses\n\tforwards KL while VI uses reverse KL. In general terms, Expectation Propagation is more computationally expensive.\n\tKL quantifies loss information when you approximate one distribution with another.

Entropy measures the quantity of information that own data and is defined as follows:\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/entropy.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Entropy\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tKL definition consists in modify entropy formula to take q distribution into account.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/kl1.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Kullback-Leibler divergence\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIf we adapt this form to the VI problem and we apply logarithms properties we have:\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image md:w-1/3 sm:4/5\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/kl_rule.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Kullback-Leibler definition\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis divergence avoids us to find the real similarity between two probability distributions and it is the measure\n\tthat is minimized at VI algorithm.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/kullback-leibler1.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Kullback-Leibler divergence\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tForwards and reverse KL comparison to approximate a bimodal distribution.
