I coded the first version 5 years ago choosing technologies simply because I knew them. That resulted in a <a class=post_link href=https://www.djangoproject.com/ target=_blank>Django</a> app with a <a class=post_link href=https://www.postgresql.org/ target=_blank>Postgres</a> database and an outdated design using <a class=post_link href=https://getbootstrap.com/ target=_blank>Bootstrap</a>. </p> <p class=post_p> After the years I used to use my blog to test new technologies so I had versions of my blog using <a class=post_link href=https://jquery.com/ target=_blank>JQuery</a>, <a class=post_link href=https://vuejs.org/ target=_blank>Vue</a>, Django, Django 2.0 using a DDD approach, ... and it was deployed on <a class=post_link href=https://www.digitalocean.com/ target=_blank>Digital Ocean</a>, <a class=post_link href=https://aws.amazon.com/ target=_blank>AWS</a>, <a class=post_link href=https://www.heroku.com/ target=_blank>Heroku</a>, Heroku using <a class=post_link href=https://www.terraform.io/ target=_blank>Terraform</a>, ... Anyone who saw the code could say that a blog should never be so over-engineer, and I agree. For this reason I decided to check which technologies were being used nowadays to make simple blogs. </p> <p class=post_p> My goal was to make a simple, fast and modern blog which allows me to write posts easily, deploy them on <a class=post_link href=https://pages.github.com/ target=_blank>Github Pages</a> and, of course, spend as little time as possible on maintenance. After check several technologies a co-worker told me about <a class=post_link href=https://svelte.dev/ target=_blank>Svelte</a> and I loved it. Svelte and its server-rendering backend <a class=post_link href=https://sapper.svelte.dev/ target=_blank>Sapper</a> were what I was looking for and there were a lot of examples of blogs made with these technologies. </p> <p class=post_p> After that I just required a new design. I was tired about Bootstrap designs so I was looking for something new, and then I found <a class=post_link href=https://tailwindcss.com/ target=_blank>Tailwind</a>. Tailwind had all that I needed. A framework which, after memorize some easy classes, allows you not to write CSS. Maybe for you this is not a plus feature but for me, a backend coder, it was perfect. </p> <h4 class="text-2xl post_section_title text-bold">The good parts of this architecture</h4> <p class=post_p> After this introduction I wanted to list the advantages that I found designing my blog with Svelte, Sapper and Tailwind. Remember that this benefits I found exist in the case of study of a simple blog. </p> <ul class=post_list> <li> <strong>Easy installation</strong>. Sapper has a great initial template and several pre-configured commands which allows you to focus on the important parts of your project. </li> <li> <strong>Great development environment</strong>. Live reload! When you modify some file, the navigator reloads the page automatically. Maybe I'm overestimating this feature but I work everyday in an outdated frontend and this feature drove me crazy! </li> <li> <strong>Static page</strong>. Sapper avoids you to export your project as a static site. Then it can be hosted and served as static files, which allows it to be deployed on hosting environments such as Github Pages. To serve the page as static files also improves notoriously the speed, obtaining better results in web positioning. You can use apps as <a class=post_link href=https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse target=_blank>Lighthouse</a> to check this. </li> <li> <strong>Elegant syntax</strong>. I worked with different frontend technologies such as JQuery, <a class=post_link href=https://knockoutjs.com/ target=_blank>Knockout</a>, <a class=post_link href=https://angular.io/ target=_blank>Angular</a> or Vue and Svelte syntax looks perfect for me. It's easy to understand, simple and elegant. In the next section you'll be able to check it in a easy example I'll show you. </li> <li> <strong>Component structure</strong>. One thing normally I don't like in a frontend based project is the way how developers structure the code. Last years I was working in projects where component HTML, Javascript and specific CSS were in different folders and then developers loose to much time searching the Javascript or de CSS associated to a particular template. Svelte joins all in one file (.svelte) and in my opinion is a great solution to improve the components reusability. </li> <li> <strong>Speed</strong>. Svelte is based on reactivity. To understand easily which reasons allows Svelte to get such good results in terms of speed compared to other frameworks you can watch this <a class=post_link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ2P6hGwcgo" target=_blank>great conference</a> of its creator Rich Harris. </li> <li> <strong>No CSS</strong>. With Tailwind you don't need to write CSS code. With its pre-defined classes you can make pretty much anything. </li> <li> <strong>Easy personalization</strong>. At Tailwind config file you can configure stuff as main colors, default spacing, text font, ... and using @apply CSS sentence you can create your own classes easily. </li> <li> <strong>0 costs</strong>. With this architecture I was able to have my blog with 0 costs (I just have to pay the domain).
