Some years ago I\n\twas working on probabilistic models and there was one which got my attention:\n\t<a href=\"http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a>.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis model was developed by David Blei, Andrew Ng y Michael I. Jordan and tries to find topics in document collections.\n\tIn other words, it groups text documents into topics that the model itself discovers. In this post I'm not going\n\tto explain the model structure and its inference, for this what better than to read the\n\t<a href=\"http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> itself.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis model is based on estimating  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">\n\tDirichlet distributions</a>. This kind of distributions model the probability of membership to a set of classes.\n\tSpecifically the model builds (using an iterative procedure) Dirichlet distributions to model the\n\tprobability of a word referring to a concrete topic and the probability of membership from each document to\n\teach of the topics. The parameters estimation of these distributions can be done using different types of\n\tBayesian inference like <a href=\"https://albertopou.herokuapp.com/#variational_inference_1\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Variational Inference</a>\n\tor sampling methods as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a>.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tProfiler uses this probabilistic model to identify, given a Twitter timeline (set of user tweets), several\n\ttopics that this user writes about. From this idea I coded a Python application that downloads all these tweets of\n\ta user, stores them, preprocesses them and finally looks for its main topics.\n</p>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Technological stack</h4>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>\n\t\tTwitter data is downloaded using <a href=\"https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Tweepy</a>.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tTo store the timelines I used a <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB</a> database with\n\t\twhich I interacted using <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Pymongo</a>.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tTextual data preprocessing was done using libraries as  <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Pandas</a>\n\t\tand <a href=\"https://github.com/nltk/nltk\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">NLTK</a>.

This is because tweets\n\tare short text documents. This reduced length causes a much smaller vocabulary and therefore a difficulty\n\tfor the model to identify differentiated topics. However in this example we can see some interesting groups.\n\tThese results are from Pedro Sánchez timeline (president of Spain). At group 1 we could see that it refers to\n\ttweets about last campaign and at group 4 we see that refers to the issue of sexist violence.\n</p>\n\t\t"},{"title":"Automatic differentiation","slug":"automatic-differentiation","tags":["#python","#tensorflow","#autograd","#linear-regression"],"date":"2017-05-03","html":"\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tDerivatives, specifically gradients (derivatives in more than one dimension spaces) and hesians (second\n\tderivatives), have become in a fundamental of machine learning. Gradient is a vector which indicates the maximum\n\tslope direction of a function at the evaluated point. This is important to move around the function space to find\n\trelative minimums or maximums (to minimize or maximize the function). Hesian gives information about the concavity\n\tand convexity of the function. Some algorithms use it to improve the exploratory movement over the function space\n\tand to find minimums and maximums faster. Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a efficiently and accurately\n\tprocedure of derivatives calculation of numerical functions, represented as computer programs. As already mentioned,\n\tthe use of derivatives is very important for model optimization. From a mathematical point of view a model is\n\tnothing more than a function that you want to minimize or maximize and derivatives are the tool to do it.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThere are several methods of derivative calculation with a computer:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Numerical differentiation.</strong>\n\t\tThis method uses derivative definition to approximate using samples of the original function. In this way\n\t\twe can approximate the gradient ∇f as:\n\t\t<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t\t\t<img class=\"md:w-1/2\" src=\"automatic-differentiation/derivative_deffinition.png\" alt=\"Derivative deffinition\">\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\twhere e<small>i</small> is i<small>th</small> unitary vector and h>0 is the step size for the approximation.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Symbolic differentiation.</strong>\n\t\tIt consists on automatic manipulation of the mathematical expressions to obtain the derivatives (similar to\n\t\twhat we did at school). It requires to implement derivative rules. The problem of this kind of derivation is\n\t\tthat it can produce long symbolic expressions which are difficult to evaluate.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Automatic Differentiation</strong>.\n\t\tIt is based on the fact that all functions can be decomposed into a finite number of operations which derivative\n\t\tis known. Combining these derivatives the derivative of the original function can be computed. Applying the\n\t\tchain rule to each elementary operation of the function we obtain the trace for the calculation of the\n\t\treal function derivative.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tNext image shows the differences between the three methods.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img src=\"automatic-differentiation/derivative_strategies.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Derivative strategies\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tMethodologies for calculating derivatives.\n</figcaption>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThere are two types of Automatic Differentiation (AD): forward mode and reverse mode. On the one hand forward mode\n\tevaluates the different parts of the function forward and then it does the same for each part of the derivative till\n\treal function derivative is obtained. On the other hand reverse mode evaluates the different parts of the function\n\tforward but after, from the derivative of the function, it obtains the partial derivatives.\n\tThis is how the backpropagation method works in neural networks, which needs the partial\n\tderivatives to update the weights of each of the neural network layers. This method avoids to reuse calculus\n\talready computed and to calculate derivatives in a very efficient way.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img src=\"automatic-differentiation/forward_AD.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Automatic differentiation forward mode\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tAD forward mode schema.\n</figcaption>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img src=\"automatic-differentiation/backward_AD.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Automatic differentiation reverse mode\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tAD reverse mode schema.\n</figcaption>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Derivatives tools</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIn this post we will be focus on function parameters optimization using Automatic Differentiation. Here are listed\n\tsome software packages to calculate derivatives and gradients:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Tensorflow</a>: It uses AD reverse mode.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Theano</a>: It uses symbolic differentiation.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Mathematica</a>: It uses symbolic differentiation.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HIPS/autograd\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Autograd</a>: It uses AD reverse mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Tensorflow</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIt is an open source library developed by Google for numerical computation using flow graphs. Before to execute\n\ta program, Tensorflow makes a flow graph where nodes represent mathematical operations and edges represent\n\tmultidimensional data vectors also called tensors. The construction of this graph avoids to obtain the most profit\n\tof system CPUs and GPUs where the program is executed. Then, completely transparent to the programmer, Tensorflow\n\tparallels everything it can among the resources it dispose.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis library was originally designed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">deep learning</a>,\n\tthe machine learning branch that studies neural networks. Tensorflow avoids, in a easy way, to implement Deep Neural\n\tNetworks (DNN), Convulational Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). However last versions\n\thave focused on satisfying the rest of machine learning community by trying to convert the\n    library in a standard for programming models of all branches. Specifically they have developed a module called\n\t<a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/README.md\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">TFLearn</a>\n\twhich has a set of models ready to use and also have updated its syntax with the intention to be more close to\n\t<a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Scikit-learn</a> syntax which is one of the most popular and important\n\tmachine learning libraries.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tOne of the most interesting aspects of this library is that it implements AD reverse model in a very elegant way.\n\tThe coder defines a model indicating its parameters as variables and practically automatically, after specify the\n\tinference algorithm, Tensorflow is in charge of calculating gradients and apply them in optimization procedures.\n</p>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Usage examples</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tBelow is the code to optimize the parameters of a lineal regression model with Tensorflow and with Autograd (both\n\tuse AD reverse model to get gradients). A lineal regression model is defined by the equation:\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img src=\"automatic-differentiation/linear_regression.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Lineal regression equation\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tWhere w represents the weight and b the bias. AD will find values for these parameters and these values\n\twill minimize Mean Squared Error.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe model is defined as code in the following way. In Tensorflow parameters to be optimized of a function are\n\tdefined as variables. Later a cost function is defined based on these parameters,\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Mean Squared Error</a>. Then optimization\n\talgorithm is specified, in this case <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Gradient Descent</a>.\n\tAnd finally we write the code to train the model (last lines). This loop, in each iteration, get a sample from\n\tthe dataset and derive the cost function to obtain the direction (gradient vector) of the local minimum, in\n\tother words, the direction that reduces Mean Squared Error. With this gradient vector weight and bias parameters\n\twill be updated (transparently to the programmer). In this way, when a sufficient number of iterations have been\n\tmade, values for the parameters that minimize the cost function will have been obtained (a local minimum will\n\thave been found).\n</p>\n<div class=\"post_code\">\n\t<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nrng = np.random\n\n# Parameters\nlearning_rate = 0.01\ntraining_epochs = 100\n\n# Training data\ntrain_X = np.asarray([3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.71, 6.93, 4.168, 9.779, 6.182, 7.59,\n\t  2.167, 7.042, 10.791, 5.313, 7.997, 5.654, 9.27, 3.1])\ntrain_Y = np.asarray([1.7, 2.76, 2.09, 3.19, 1.694, 1.573, 3.366, 2.596, 2.53,\n\t  1.221, 2.827, 3.465, 1.65, 2.904, 2.42, 2.94, 1.3])\nn_samples = train_X.shape[0]\n\n# Graph input data\nX = tf.placeholder('float')\nY = tf.placeholder('float')\n\n# Optimizable parameters with random initialization\nweight = tf.Variable(rng.randn(), name='weight')\nbias = tf.Variable(rng.randn(), name='bias')\n\n# Linear model\npredictions = (X * weight) + bias\n\n# Loss function: Mean Squared Error\nloss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.pow(predictions-Y, 2))/(2*n_samples)\n\n# Gradient descent optimizer\noptimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate).minimize(loss)\n\n# Initializing the variables\ninit = tf.global_variables_initializer()\n\n# Launch the graph\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\nsess.run(init)\nfor epoch in range(training_epochs):\n\tfor (x, y) in zip(train_X, train_Y):\n\t\tsess.run(optimizer, feed_dict={X: x, Y: y})\ntrain_error = sess.run(loss, feed_dict={X: train_X, Y: train_Y})\nprint('Train error={}'.format(train_error))\n\n# Test error\ntest_X = np.asarray([6.83, 4.668, 8.9, 7.91, 5.7, 8.7, 3.1, 2.1])\ntest_Y = np.asarray([1.84, 2.273, 3.2, 2.831, 2.92, 3.24, 1.35, 1.03])\ntest_error = sess.run(\n\ttf.reduce_sum(tf.pow(predictions - Y, 2)) / (2 * test_X.shape[0]),\n\tfeed_dict={X: test_X, Y: test_Y})\nprint('Test error={}'.format(test_error))\n\nprint('Weight={} Bias={}'.format(sess.run(weight), sess.run(bias)))\n\n# Graphic display\nplt.plot(train_X, train_Y, 'ro', label='Original data')\nplt.plot(train_X, sess.run(weight) * train_X\n\t\t + sess.run(bias), label='Fitted line')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n\t<small class=\"text-gray-900 leading-relaxed text-sm\">\n\t\tLearning weight and bias parameters of a linear regression model with Tensorflow.\n\t</small>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img src=\"automatic-differentiation/linear_regression_tf_results.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Linear regression with Tensoflow\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tOptimization results of model parameters of a lineal regression using Tensorflow.\n</figcaption>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tUsing Autograd all is more visible than in Tensorflow.

These threads will be executed in one kernel, in other words, a GPU program.\n</p>\n<div class=\"post_code\">\n\t<pre><code>/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */\n/* MULTI-NODE AND PARALLEL MATRIX-MATRIX PRODUCT WITH MPI AND CUDA           */\n/*                                                                           */\n/* File:         mmpmpicuda.cu                                               */\n/* Author:       Alberto Pou Quirós (Github: bertini36)                      */ \n/* Description:  This program performs a matrix product (A * B = C)          */\n/*               distributing the computation between multiple nodes         */\n/*               with MPI technology and parallelizing the computation in    */\n/*               every node with Nvidia CUDA technology                      */\n/* Compilation:  nvcc -I/opt/mpi/bullxmpi/1.2.9.1/include                    */  \n/*               -L/opt/mpi/bullxmpi/1.2.9.1/lib -lmpi -ldl -lm -lnuma       */\n/*               -lrt -lnsl -lutil -lm -ldl mmpmpicuda.cu -o mmpmpicuda      */\n/* Strategy:                                                                 */\n/*                  Example 16x16 matrices with 4 nodes:                     */\n/*                   _________________16________________                     */\n/*                   |                                 |                     */\n/*                   |               NODE 1            | 4                   */\n/*                   |_________________________________|                     */\n/*                   |                                 |                     */\n/*                   |               NODE 2            | 4                   */\n/*              C =  |_________________________________|    16               */ \n/*                   |                                 |                     */\n/*                   |               NODE 3            | 4                   */\n/*                   |_________________________________|                     */\n/*                   |                                 |                     */ \n/*                   |               NODE 4            | 4                   */\n/*                   |_________________________________|                     */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*                  Node 1 computes 4 rows of result matrix:                 */\n/*                   __________________________________                      */\n/*                   |                                 |                     */\n/*                   |         4x16 CUDA block         |                     */\n/*                   |_________________________________|                     */\n/*                                                                           */\n/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */\n\n#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;assert.h&gt;\n#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;\n\n#define N 1024\n\n#define err(format, ...) do { fprintf(stderr, format, ##__VA_ARGS__); exit(1); } while (0)\n\nstruct timeval start_time, end_time;\n\ninline void checkCuda(cudaError_t e) {\n    if (e != cudaSuccess) {\n        err(\"CUDA Error %d: %s\\n\", e, cudaGetErrorString(e));\n    }\n}\n\n__global__ void matrixProduct(double *matrix_a, double *matrix_b, double *matrix_c, int width, int nrows, int my_rank) {\n    int row = threadIdx.y + blockDim.y * blockIdx.y;\n    int col = threadIdx.x + blockDim.x * blockIdx.x; \n    matrix_c[row * width + col] = 0;\n    for (int k=0; k&lt;width; k++) {\n        matrix_c[row * width + col] += matrix_a[(row * width) + (my_rank * nrows * width) + k] * matrix_b[k * width + col];\n    }\n}\n\nvoid initializeMatrices(double matrix_a[N][N], double matrix_b[N][N]) {\n    int i, j;\n    srand(time(NULL));\n    for (i=0; i&lt;N; i++) {\n        for (j=0; j&lt;N; j++) {\n            matrix_a[i][j] = rand();\n            matrix_b[i][j] = rand();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid showMatrices(double matrix_a[N][N], double matrix_b[N][N], double matrix_c[N][N]) {\n    int i, j;\n    srand(time(NULL));\n    printf(\"***** MATRIX A ***** \\n\");\n    for (i=0; i&lt;N; i++) {\n        for (j=0; j&lt;N; j++) {\n            (j % N == N-1) ?

Last months I was learning about this\n\tfield, specifically about a type of inference on these models known as Variational Inference, and I reckon can be\n\tinteresting to write a set of posts summarizing my experience about it thanks to my teacher\n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapdevilaPujol\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Joan Capdevila</a>.\n</p>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Probabilistic Machine Learning</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tLast decades studies about machine learning has caused the appearance of a wide variety of algorithms to solve\n\ta large set of problems covering areas such as driving autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, speech recognition\n\tor user ranking for marketing campaigns. These algorithms are mainly based on aa construction of a model which\n\tdescribes data as closely as possible.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tA model is a compact description of a set of data that avoids us to make predictions about future samples. The main\n\tdifference between a conventional machine learning model and a probabilistic one is that the last avoids to model\n\tuncertainty, in other words, it avoids to know how probably is a prediction to be fulfilled. This aspect can\n\tbe very valuable in areas such as medicine or economy where risk about to take a bad decision can be detrimental to\n\ta person's health or lead to financial loss.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/schema_situation.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Probabilistic Machine Learning situation\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tProbabilistic machine learning situation at artificial intelligence area\n</figcaption>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis kind of models uses the probability theory to model priori information, in this way the algorithm is not\n\tbased just on sample data. These models permit the use of different datasets to learn (this is useful when\n\twe have a small quantity of data) and to define complex models with a quantity of random variables required.\n\tThey also support online leaning, you don't need to retrain the full model each time you obtain new data, you just\n\trequire to update some probabilities. They are also very useful in decision-making, when a robust explanation of a\n\tmodel is required. Finally they are generative models, thanks to the distributions that they infer, they allow\n\tto generate new data simulating values ​​of any random variable of the model.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tUnlike discriminant models which only model the probability of the variable to be predicted, a generative model is\n\ta complete model which uses all the variables (observed and latent), allowing multiple questions to be\n\tanswered.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe construction of this type of models with latent variables is done following Box Loop philosophy. This loop\n\twas created by the statistician\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">George E. P. Box</a>.

For\n\ttraditional machine learning methods parameters are values that are determined by optimization algorithms\n\tminimizing an error function. The bayesian point of view is a little bit different. For a bayesian all the\n\tunknown parameters are described by probability distributions and observation of evidence avoids to update\n\tthese distrubutions using Bayes rule.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Bayes rule</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe first thing you need to be clear about to understand Bayesian inference is Bayes rule. Bayes rule indicates\n\thow a priori probability about an event has to be updated after observe evidences about it. From a bayesian point\n\tof view there are no differences between parameters and observed variables, both are random variables. I'm going to\n\tuse x to reference observed variables and θ to reference latent variables.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image w-1/6\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/bayes_rule.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Bayes rule\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThe following explains what is each term of the formula, being x and &theta; data and model\n\tparameters respectively:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Posterior p(&theta;|x)</strong>: It is the probability of data, the probability that the model with &theta;\n\t\tparameters has generated x data.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Likelihood p(x|&theta;)</strong>: It is the probability of data assuming that are modeled by a\n\t\tparametrized distribution. The way to calculate it depends on the model. Usually it is used to assess\n\t\tthe quality of a model.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Prior p(&theta;)</strong>: It is the probability of the parameters. In this factor of the formula\n\t\tis where prior knowledge is reflected, information that we have before to observe any data\n\t\tobservation.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Evidence p(x)</strong>: This is the evidence from data. It is calculated as &int; p(x,&theta;)d&theta;. Usually it\n\t\tcan't be calculated but, as it is a normalizing constant of the model, it does not affect. When two\n\t\tprobabilistic models are compared, important factors are the ones which depend on θ because p(x) will be\n\t\tthe same for each model because it just depends on data.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tProduct p(x|θ)p(θ) is also known as joint probability: p(θ,x).\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tUse the likelihood to estimate θ parameters is known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) while if you take\n\tthe prior into account then is known as Maximum A Posteriori estimation (MAP). MLE and MAP are equivalents if\n\tthere is an uniform prior. However these methods only allow estimating a mean, a median and a mode of the\n\tposterior and maybe your goal requires to model uncertainty or to generate new data. In theses cases we would need\n\tto know posterior distribution. As we will see, methods as Variational Inference (VI) or Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n\t(MCMC) allow to infer this distribution. Taking into account the Bayes normalizer constant p(x) is what allows\n\tthese methods to calculate a posterior distribution.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tA summary of this formula would be: At the beginning we have a belief (prior) about an event θ (p(θ)), for example,\n\tthat the height of Barcelona population is described by a Normal distribution. After we observe evidences (x),\n\ta sample of the heights of Barcelona population. With this evidence our belief about θ has to be updated, in\n\tother words, Normal distribution which described the height of Barcelona population has to be updated. This\n\tchange is reflected by the posterior distribution (p(θ|x)). In this example we can appreciate the support to\n\tonline learning that offers this kind of models.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/online_learning.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Online learning\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tAt the end it is an iterative process of updating beliefs (prior) based on evidences (x) where posterior of one\n\titeration will be the prior of next one.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tPosterior inference algorithms avoid to analyze information under certain assumptions (priors) discovering a\n\thidden structure which best fits with our data. When all relations between model random variable are\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">conjugated</a>, this is, when joint\n\tdistribution has the same form as the prior, posterior can be calculated analytically. This is the\n\tcase of models like Dirichlet-Categorical o Normal Inverse Wishart-Normal. In the opposite case, the problem of\n\tthis formula resides in the calculation of the evidence (p(x)). For many models of interest (no conjugated) to\n\tcalculate a posterior is computationally intractable because the integral over all latent variables of data\n\tthat requires to calculate the evidence. For these models, another strategy is required to obtain the posterior,\n\tfor that reason the calculation of the posterior becomes an approximation problem.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Posterior approximation</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tProbabilistic machine learning uses latent variables to describe data hidden structure, some relations\n\tbetween observed and latent variables are modeled using probability distributions and inference algorithms are used\n\tto estimate the posterior, that is the conditional distribution about latent variables given the observed\n\tvariables. Due to the fact that in most cases we are working in spaces with many dimensions, the calculation of\n\tposterior expectation, E(p(θ|x)), is impossible to obtain analytically and computationally, for this reason some\n\tinference methods have been created to approximate this distribution. Bayesian inference concept comes from the\n\tset of tools which have been developed to approximate this posterior and it is one of the central problems in\n\tbayesian statistics. Nowadays there are 2 algorithmic branches:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"post_list\">\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\tMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n\t\t</a>:\n\t\tSampling approximate inference.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\tVariational Inference (VI)\n\t\t</a>:\n\t\tStructural approximate inference.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tOn the one hand, MCMC is based on the construction of a Markov chain over all latent variables being the posterior\n\tits stationary distribution. After the chain is executed till it arrives to its equilibrium point.\n\tFinally, results obtained sampling the Markov chain in its stationary section, are the posterior samples. The\n\tbest known algorithms of this family are\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Metropolis–Hastings</a>\n\t, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Gibbs sampling</a> and\n\t<a href=\"{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Monte_Carlo\">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a>.\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tOn the other hand, Variational Inference approximates the posterior creating an analytical approximation, the\n\tvariational model, which is adjusted in order to reduce the distance with the posterior. In this family the\n\tproblem is transformed from an approximation one to an optimization one.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Probabilistic Graphical Models</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIn the bayesian field, a model represents a joint probability over all random variables of the problem.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image w-1/5\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/joint_dist.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Joint distribution\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tA very practical way of representing these models is using\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">probabilistic graphical models</a>.

For\n\texample, the following probabilistic graphical model, <i>y</i> variable is local while <i>z</i> variable is a\n\tglobal one. When a node appears obscured it means that it is an observed variable.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/global_local_variables.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Model example\">\n</figure>\n<h4 class=\"post_section_title text-2xl text-black\">Variational inference</h4>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIn next posts we will focus on the different variational strategies for posterior approach.\n</p>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Strategy</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tAs already mentioned, Variational Inference consists in defining a distribution, q(&theta;|&lambda;), whose parameters &lambda;\n\twill be optimized in order to reduce the differences with the posterior p(&theta;|x). This new distribution is known as\n\tvariational model and the posterior as probabilistic model. To summarize, VI goal is to optimize variational model\n\t&lambda; parameters in order to reduce the distance with probabilistic model p(&theta;|x). &lambda; parameters are known also as\n\tvariational parameters.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/variational_inference.jpg\"\n\t\t alt=\"Variational inference\">\n</figure>\n<h5 class=\"post_section_title text-xl text-black\">Kullback-Leibler divergence</h5>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tTo calculate Euclidean distance between distribution parameters to establish the similarity between both is an\n\timperfect measure since we are comparing distributions and not points. Imagine a Normal distribution with 0 mean\n\tand 5 variance, N(0, 5), and another one with 5 mean and 5 variance, N(5, 5). These two distributions are very\n\tsimilar but they are separated by an Euclidean distance of 5. If now we compare first defined Normal distribution\n\tN(0, 5) with another Normal distribution with 2 mean and 7 variance, N(2, 7), looks like they are more different\n\tbut Euclidean distance that separates them is 4. For this reason we have to use another measure: Kullback-Leibler\n\tdivergence (KL).\n</p>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tKL is a divergence, in other words, a non-simmetric distance, it isn't the same to calculate KL[p(θ|x)||q(θ|λ)]\n\t(forwards KL) than KL[q(θ|λ)||p(θ|x)] (reverse KL). The fact of use one or another rises to different algorithms:\n\t <a href=\"https://tminka.github.io/papers/ep/minka-ep-uai.pdf\" class=\"post_link\" target=\"_blank\">Expectation Propagation</a> uses\n\tforwards KL while VI uses reverse KL. In general terms, Expectation Propagation is more computationally expensive.\n\tKL quantifies loss information when you approximate one distribution with another. It is based on the concept of\n\tentropy. Entropy measures the quantity of information that own data and is defined as follows:\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/entropy.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Entropy\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tKL definition consists in modify entropy formula to take q distribution into account.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/kl1.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Kullback-Leibler divergence\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tIf we adapt this form to the VI problem and we apply logarithms properties we have:\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image w-1/3\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/kl_rule.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Kullback-Leibler definition\">\n</figure>\n<p class=\"post_p\">\n\tThis divergence avoids us to find the real similarity between two probability distributions and it is the measure\n\tthat is minimized at VI algorithm.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"post_figure flex justify-center\">\n\t<img class=\"post_image\"\n\t\t src=\"variational-inference-1/kullback-leibler1.png\"\n\t\t alt=\"Kullback-Leibler divergence\">\n</figure>\n<figcaption class=\"post_image_figcaption\">\n\tForwards and reverse KL comparison to approximate a bimodal distribution.
